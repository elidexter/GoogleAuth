# GoogleAuth
Basic and Google authentication combined

Sample about autenticating either basic auth(email and password) or invoking Google auth as you wish..(put your client id and secret generated in google console)

If you want to call google as default login without redirect to login page, change DefaultChallengeScheme to google(commented line in startup)
